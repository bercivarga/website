$description: creative problem solving through computers and communication

[home]
    Hi, Berci here, a 23 year old digital marketer and self-taught front-end developer.

    I like to work on modern challenges through my computer and communication.

    In my free time I like to take on difficult bouldering problems and exploring the hidden spots of Rotterdam with my girlfriend.

        ## Work

        ### Digital Marketer
        #### @ Octo / Spotr.ai | *2019 - now*
        > Since the fall of 2019 I've been a member of Octo's / Spotr.ai's team. My tasks cover a wide range of responsibilities from managing and developing the company website to conducting market research. I am fortunate to have this opportunity at an inspiring company such as this one, where I was able to take a deeper look into the world of tech startups and develop my interests without limitations.

        ### Marketing intern
        #### @ Octo | *2019*
        > I've spent 6 months as a marketing intern at Octo between April and August of 2019. I entered with a very basic skillset and finished as an aspiring digital creative full of great ideas for the future. After my internship I was offered a permanent position as a junior marketer.

        ### Assistant floor manager
        #### @ Contemporary Rotterdam | *2016 - 2021*
        > For 4 years I worked at a student hotel in the city of Schiedam as a nightime receptionist and assistant floor manager. The hotel housed about 170 international students at all times, and I had the pleasure of helping them with their complaints and questions about life in the area. This position has taught me discipline, management, and a whole lot of patience.

        ## Education

        ### Master's Degree in Media & Business
        #### @ Erasmus University Rotterdam | *2020 - 2021*
        > With a focus on entrepeneurship and new media technologies, I closed my academic carreer by obtaining my master's at EUR.

        ### Bachelor's Degree in International Communication and Media
        #### @ Erasmus University Rotterdam | *2017 - 2020*
        > Throughout my bachelor I specialised in new media technologies and business and finished with a thesis on the implications of digital storytelling in video advertisements of SMEs.

        ### One year of International Business Administration
        #### @ Rotterdam School of Management | *2016 - 2017*
        > I've spent my first year in university exploring my interests and trying to find myself as a newcomer to adult life. I found this programme quite limiting for students' creativity, so I decided to drop out and pursue a bachelor in communication and media instead at ESHCC.

    [projects(projects)]
        I take pride in my projects. As a self-taught developer I find it extremely motivating for myself to continuously publish projects and see my progress over time.
        
        I enjoy working with `React` and `TypeScript`, and as of late `TailwindCSS`. I aim to publish a new project every one-to-two weeks to practice old and new skills that can make me a more skilled developer.

        Most of these projects have been made with an emphasis on practicing technical skills and JavaScript concepts. Some of them look beautiful, some don't. 
        
        I'm proud of them all nonetheless.
